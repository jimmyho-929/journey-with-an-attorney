# journey-with-an-attorney

This project is a blog to keep track of the places my girlfriend and I have traveled. There are many places all around the world we would like to visit and it'll be fun looking back on the land we've stepped foot on.

The features I have included are

Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views
A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes,
Create and populate a JavaScript array with one or more values and display the contents of some or all of the array on your page
